#ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Simon.
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, from level design with the source engine to programming with languages, mostly C# and anything around the .NET ecosystem.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge in programming due to Uni studies and some personal interest. Also doing a handy work in learning Game Design Engines, mostly Unity and Godot.
